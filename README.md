# API Automation with Playwright
This is an API automation framework that has an enhanced asserting and validating options with playwright.

Used Framework: https://playwright.dev/docs/test-api-testing


## install
`npm install`

## Setup
Configure the dotenv package and create a .env file from the sample.env file. Enter your base URL and token in the env file.

 

## General Declarations
If you clone the repo, there is a file named Playwright.config.ts
### playwright.config.ts
![ts file](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55917380/196962076-bdf551a3-bd87-457c-9f2c-924f022c913e.png)


It contains all the default Pre-headers for executing our test framework. As Playwright is a standalone framework, we only need this config file for performing API tests, where it will handle all types of default headers and authorization. By using dot env package, you can easily initialize the baseURL and token from this config file only.


### payload.js

For executing different API scenarios, you may need to use .post method to send a post request; which can basically create any object. For a neat and robust experience, a user can create custom payload for different type of post requests within exportable-functions.

### response.js
In this file, insert your desired response status based on your project documentation. Ensure that all the responses are according to the positive and negative scenarios, otherwise, all utils will fail.

## Executing the test cases with Utils
This framework has several Utils that works and verifies all types of API requests. All the requests are categorized as positive and negative requests. By default, store all test cases are stored inside the tests' folder. When a user writes a new test case, here are some steps they need to follow for successful execution.
In this manner, you can add many test cases and assertions at once to test out API's for them.

1. We need to import **test**, **expect** from playwright library in the beginning of the code to use all the functions.
2. We need to import the **payload.js** only for the post requests if requires.
3. We need to import all the utils functions from utils page in order to work with the enhancements
4. We will use **test** block of playwright for initialize our test case. Note: Each time user will write new test scenario, **request** and **baseURL** is needed to pass inside async array function so that one can use these functions inside one test block.  `test("A new test scenario", async () => {});`
5. Inside the test case please declare one constant and inside that make a request accoding to your need from our utils, like , `const result = await GetPositiveResponse("Extention of the baseURL");`
6. Thats it, Just for your verification you can now console log the declared variable and it will return the result with JSON format directly. One dont need to check with any default expect method like `expect(response.status()).toBe(200)` to be written multiple times. Utils functions covers all the default assersion method. So if one needs to verify specific data inside the reponse then only the person can use expect function but apart from that utils covered all. 
7. In the Utils, We also implemented custom matcher named `toBeWithinRange` which will verifies the range for requests. Anybody make changes to Utils  and modify it accordingly.

So in this manner one can add many test cases and assertions at once to test out API's for that.
## Run the test cases
To run all the test scripts available on the specs folder
`npx playwright test`
<img width="1007" alt="four" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55917380/183078736-f274358c-3538-4478-8684-ce79d7bb0219.png">

To run a single file 
`npx playwright test filename.test.js`

## Reporting
Playwright has an in-built reporting tool, and it also supports 3rd party reports. To use in-built report, you should just add reporter: 'html' in the config file and after each execution, a report will be generated. For more information about how to configure reports in playwright, refer to the documentation:https://playwright.dev/docs/test-reporters
